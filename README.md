# Data Science Series ep0 - Experimenting With Data!

This introductory material accompains the presentation available at https://www.slideshare.net/AndreaMontemaggio/experimenting-with-data.

## Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.7
- IPython notebook environemnt such as:
    - [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
    - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Install dependencies

Before being able to run your experiments with the provided notebook you need to prepare your environemnt.

You might want to create a Python Virtual Environment to work in isolation without cluttering your Python system-wide installation. You can refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for creating and activating a Virtual Environment.

Once you have your Virtual Environment activated, you can install the required dependencies running the following command in your terminal.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
