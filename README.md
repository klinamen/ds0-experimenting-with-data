# Data Science Series ep0 - Experimenting With Data!

This introductory material accompains the presentation available at https://www.slideshare.net/AndreaMontemaggio/experimenting-with-data.

## Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.7
- IPython notebook environemnt such as:
    - [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
    - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Install dependencies

Before being able to run your experiments with the provided notebook you need to prepare your environemnt.

You might want to create a Python Virtual Environment to work in isolation without cluttering your Python system-wide installation. You can refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for creating and activating a Virtual Environment.

Once you have your Virtual Environment activated, you can install the required dependencies running the following command in your terminal.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the notebook

One you have your environment set up, you can open the project root folder with Visual Studio Code and look at the notebook.

Prior to running the notebook, make sure you have selected the right Python kernel, that is the one referring to the Virtual Environment.
